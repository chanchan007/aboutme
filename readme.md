# HTML / CSS Lab

In this lab you will practice converting a design into HTML and CSS

The design is included in `design.png`.

Convert the design into HTML in the `index.html` file, and then write the CSS in `main.css`.

We'll provide some style information below. **You can approximate spacing.**

Content for the page can be found in copy.txt.

Links do not need to go anywhere.

## Provided style information

#### I have already set these styles on 'body' to get the page started:

  - High-level text properties
  - "Lato" font
  - 1.5 line-height
  - max-width 720px
  - 54px of padding
  - solid border on the left 6px wide with a color of #e2231a

#### YOU DO:
  Links (and other red colored text)
  color #e2231a

  Headings:
  font-weight: 100

  Date:
  color #cccccc

  Article Title
  color black

  HINT: You can make the images fit nicely inside their parent elements by setting `width: 100%`.

  HINT 2: To right align "continues" it may be easiest for now to make that element either a heading (like h6) or a link inside a heading and set `text-align: right` on the heading.

  HINT 3: For adjusting the vertical space between elements, you can use `margin-top` and `margin-bottom`. For example `margin-bottom: 10px` to put space beneath an element.  You should use the browser inspector (right click > inspect element) to determine which elements' margins are causing current spacing and adjust accordingly.

  Bonus (DO AFTER ALL ELSE COMPLETE): look up how to do element hover styles

  Links hover color: #aa0000
